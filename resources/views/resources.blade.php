		<h3 class="panel-title">Common Pitfalls</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="panel-body">
		<ul>
		<li>You can use the Y button to swap between Silver Arrows and Normal Arrows, the Red and
			Blue Boomerangs, the Mushroom and the Magic Powder, and the Shovel and the Flute.
		<li>In the dark world, you can hookshot over the river north of the pyramid. Look for the
			arrow made out of grass!
		<li>If you find yourself at bumper cave with the Cape but without the Hookshot, try walking
			over the top left of the gap. No hookshot needed!
		<li>Agahnim's barrier can be bypassed with the Magic Cape or destroyed with an upgraded sword.
		<li>If you have the Magic Mirror, Desert Palace can be reached from Misery Mire without the Book of Mudora.
		<li>Bombos burns things as well as the Fire Rod which is useful in Ice Palace.
		<li>You can cross small gaps by rebounding off of walls or objects using the Pegasus Boots.
		<li>Sahasrahla gives you his item when you speak to him with the Pendant of Courage.
		<li>The Super Bomb spawns when you have acquired crystals 5 and 6.
		<li>The Smith and the Purple chest will stay following you through Save and Quit.
		<li>You are never required to navigate a dark room; the lamp will be available to light your way, so go out and find it!
		<li>Keys might not be accessible if they are not required to finish the game. For instance, the Skull Woods big key might be in the big chest.

		<h3 class="panel-title">Differences</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="panel-body">
		<h4>What has been randomized?</h4>
		<ul>
		<li>Nearly all unique item locations
		<li>Pendants and crystals (check your map!)
		<li>The medallions required to open Misery Mire and Turtle Rock
		<li>Enemy drops and prize pulls (e.g. trees)
		</ul>
		<h4>What has stayed the same?</h4>
		<ul>
		<li>Link's Uncle gives you the Fighter's Sword (except in Open Mode)
		<li>All shops throughout Hyrule
		<li>The archery game and various rupee chest games
		<li>Small keys underneath pots or held by enemies
		</ul>
		<h4>What changed from the original game?</h4>
		<p>There are a few changes from the original game which enhance gameplay and prevent you from
			getting stuck. The Japanese 1.0 version is used as a base ROM because it allows use of
			some exclusive glitches in some of the advanced game modes.</p>
		<ul>
		<li>You no longer need the Lamp to push the bookshelf during the prologue.
		<li>You can now see in dark rooms in the Sewers without the Lamp (except in Open mode).
		<li>You can toggle between items which share the same slot in the menu by pressing Y. For
			example you can now hold both the Shovel and Flute and switch between them.
		<li>The sub-menu for the Bottles no longer automatically opens. You can open it with X or
			toggle between bottles with Y.
		<li>The water levels within Swamp Palace will always revert to being drained when you exit
			the overworld screen. This prevents you accidentally drowning keys underwater and getting
			stuck!
		<li>The file select screen has a random row of symbols at the top. These are a unique
			identifier for each seed generated to ensure all racers have the correct file loaded.
			They do not have any other relevance.
		<li>The Pyramid and Waterfall of Wishing Faeries no longer upgrade your items. Instead their
			caves contains two chests each which account for the usual upgrades having been shuffled
			into the mix.
