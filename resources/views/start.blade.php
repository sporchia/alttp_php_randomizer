			<p>You'll need the base ROM. This should be a <span style="font-weight:bold;">Zelda no
				Densetsu: Kamigami no Triforce v1.0</span> ROM. Don't worry if you can't read Japanese;
				the patching process provides English text while keeping the glitches unique to the
				original version intact.</p>

					<p>Head on over to <a href="/randomizer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Generate Randomize Game</a> and provide your ROM. The next screen will show a variety of game options. For your first
				few runs, we recommend changing "Difficulty" to "Easy" and leaving the rest of the
				settings as is. Then click "Generate ROM" and you'll be given a newly minted
				randomized game!</p>

		</div>
		<div class="card-body">
			<p>First, you'll need something to run your newly minted game on. We recommend using an
				emulator. An emulator is a program that closely replicates SNES hardware, allowing you to
				run SNES games on your computer. You can get the recommended emulator, SNES9x, at their
				website <a href="http://www.snes9x.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
			<p>While you can play using only your keyboard, a controller makes for a better experience.
				While most USB controllers will work, we recommend an
				<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002B9XB0E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iBuffalo Classic USB
				Gamepad</a> or an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Y0LUQFE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">8Bitdo SFC30 Wireless Bluetooth Controller</a>.</p>
			<p>There are other supported ways to play, including on original SNES hardware. There are
				also certain emulators, such as zsnes, that won't work correctly with the randomizer.
				Join us on <a href="https://discord.gg/alttprandomizer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a> to learn more!</p>
			<p>NOTE FOR SNESMINI PLAYERS: Rename your ROM file to have 61 characters or fewer as the SNESMini can't handle long file names.</p>

			<p>You're finally ready to go! The best way to learn is to load up your new ROM and start
				playing. If you feel like you're stuck, check out this list of common pitfalls, or ask
				on <a href="https://discord.gg/alttprandomizer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a>.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You can use the Y button to swap between Silver Arrows and Normal Arrows, the Red
					and Blue Boomerangs, the Mushroom and the Magic Powder, and the Shovel and the
					Flute.</li>
				<li>You can save and quit with either the Frog or Purple Chest following you to bring
					it back to the light world without the Mirror.</li>
				<li>In the dark world, you can hookshot over the river north of the pyramid. Look for
					the arrow made out of grass!</li>
				<li>You can use the boots to dash into walls, blocks, and pots, knocking you backwards,
					in order to cross a gap.</li>
				<li>If you find yourself at bumper cave with the Cape but without the Hookshot, try
					walking over the top left of the gapâ€”no Hookshot needed!</li>
				<li>Keys might not be accessible if they are not required to finish the game. For instance, the Skull Woods big key might be in the big chest.</li>
			</ul>
